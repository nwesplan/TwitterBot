# This is my Twitter scraping program I made for my final project in Python programming.

I am new to GitHub and I am trying to exlude files from committing, but the main files ares:

Database.py,
Tweets_To_Database_Driver.py,
Tweets_To_Database.py,
Driver_GUI.py, 
GUI_UI.py

GUI_UI.py is the auto-generated code from Qt5 Designer.
Driver_GUI.py is the main front end program.

Database.py handles all the database functionality on the back end.

Tweets_To_Database.py is the subclass that is called when grabbing live streaming tweets.

Tweets_To_Database_Driver.py is the main program that controls the insertion of tweets into the database.

The html file is one example of the information this program can grab from tweets and plots geocode information on a world map.
