# This is my Twitter scraping program I made for the final project in Python.

I am new to GitHub and I am trying to exlude files from committing, but the main files ares:

Database.py
Tweets_To_Database_Driver.py
Tweets_To_Database
Driver_GUI
GUI_UI

GUI_UI.py is the auto-generated code from Qt5 Designer
Driver_GUI.py is the main front end program

Database.py handles all the database functionality on the back end
Tweets_To_Database.py is the subclass that is called when grabbing live streaming tweets
Tweets_To_Database_Driver.py is the main program that controls the insertion of tweets into the database.
